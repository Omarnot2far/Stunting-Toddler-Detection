### Stunting among children aged <5 years
Child growth is the most widely used indicator of nutritional status in a community and is internationally recognized as an important public-health indicator for monitoring health in populations. In addition, children who suffer from growth retardation as a result of poor diets and/or recurrent infections tend to have a greater risk of suffering illness and death (accoroding to WHO).

This dataset is based on the z-score formula for determining stunting according to WHO (World Health Organization), that focuses on stunting detection in children under five years old. It consists of 121,000 rows of data, detailing information on the age, sex, height, and nutritional status of toddlers.
